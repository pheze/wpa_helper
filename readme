I thought this script might be useful to others. 
There's really nothing fancy there.. nothing you couldn't have done yourself or found on the internet. 
Feel free to hack that script for your need.. if you think your hack could help others, send me a patch and I'll happily upload it and gives you full credit.

Note:
This script is really made for my need and probably only works on archlinux. However, it's really easy to adapt :)
